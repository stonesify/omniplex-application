**Omniplex Applications** represent a new paradigm in web application development. 
These are omnipresent applications, capable of being deployed anywhere without altering their functionality or configuration. 
They are designed to be cost-effective by leveraging the full potential of cloud-native features, while remaining cloud-agnostic, 
meaning they are independent of specific cloud providers. Omniplex Applications are built with cloud-native principles in mind, 
making them easy to deploy in Function as a Service (FaaS) environments.

Even though they are cloud-native friendly, Omniplex Applications can run on-premise, 
on bare-metal servers, and locally, making them completely independent of any specific platform. 
This flexibility ensures that they can be deployed and run anywhere, providing unparalleled versatility.

Omniplex Applications are designed to leverage the Continuum Architecture, 
which provides a robust and scalable foundation for building flexible and adaptive applications. 
They require zero or minimal configuration to get started, making them simple to deploy and manage. 
These applications are flexible, adaptive, and scalable, capable of growing from nano to macro applications. 
They embody all the best characteristics of modern applications, adhering to best practices and industry standards.

Omniplex Applications do not reinvent the wheel or replace existing standard or best practices 
in the market but serve as a complement to create future-proof and next-generation applications.
